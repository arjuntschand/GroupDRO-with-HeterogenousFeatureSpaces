Subject: GroupDRO TextCaps Progress Update & Task Decision

Hi [Name],

I wanted to give you a quick update on the GroupDRO project progress with the TextCaps dataset.

**Current Status:**
- Successfully integrated TextCaps dataset (using Hugging Face, ~22k train / ~3k test samples)
- Implemented multi-modal grouping: Group 0 (visual images) vs Group 1 (OCR text captions)
- Set up baseline and GroupDRO training pipelines with optimized hyperparameters
- Currently running classification experiments (predicting top 10 classes from images/text)

**Key Decision Point:**
TextCaps is designed for caption generation (image → text), but we're currently doing classification (image → class label) because:
- Fits our existing GroupDRO framework more directly
- Faster to implement and validate
- Still demonstrates multi-modal alignment

However, caption generation would be:
- More authentic to the dataset's purpose
- More impressive for a conference paper
- Better test of multi-modal understanding

**Options:**
A) Keep classification for now (faster results, validate GroupDRO works)
B) Switch to caption generation (more authentic, requires decoder architecture + sequence losses)
C) Do both (classification first to validate, then add caption generation for paper)

**Next Steps:**
- Finish current classification experiments (50 epochs, full dataset)
- Then decide whether to implement caption generation or move to other datasets

**Question:** What's your preference on the classification vs caption generation decision? I'm leaning toward Option C (do both) to get quick validation results first, then add the more impressive caption generation task.

Let me know your thoughts!

Best,
[Your name]
